# AI in Software Engineering Blog Series

This project focuses on creating a series of blog posts about using AI tools and techniques in software engineering workflows.

## Project Context

A comprehensive exploration of how AI is transforming software development, from code generation and review to testing and deployment. This series aims to provide practical insights and real-world examples for software engineers looking to integrate AI into their development process.

## Project Goals

- Document practical AI applications in software engineering
- Share insights and lessons learned from using AI tools
- Provide actionable guidance for teams adopting AI in their workflows
- Explore both opportunities and challenges of AI-assisted development

## Project Structure

- `drafts/` - Blog post drafts and content development
- `research/` - Research materials on specific topics that may span multiple posts
- `shower-thoughts.md` - Quick, single-bullet ideas for potential future development

## Working on This Project

This project involves research, writing, and potentially code examples demonstrating AI integration in software engineering practices. Use the drafts directory for developing individual posts and the research directory for deeper topic exploration that informs the series.
