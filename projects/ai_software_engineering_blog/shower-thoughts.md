# Shower Thoughts

Quick, unformed ideas about AI in software engineering. Single bullets that might become posts, research topics, or just interesting observations.

## Ideas

- It is good at refactoring, but it is token intensive
- I found it difficult to always get it to follow my instructions while coding
- Manual review is still very important
- Knowing the jargon of software engineering is extremely useful
- It has never been more important to write fast tests and fast tools
- Providing a structured process for complex tasks is very important. E.g. the public decorator thing. It was tasked with adding decorators to hundreds of symbols. It ended up writing its own scripts to do it. It also starts batching operations. However in the end I should have been more prescriptive about the process as it ended up doing stuff that was pretty inefficient.
- It does tons of grepping in the codebase for tool-based searches. I bet there is a ton of upside in terms of speed and precision to having ast- and type-system-aware tooling
- Incredible at searching historically
- Refactoring into coarse-grained modules is important
- Asking it to refactor to generalization an effective technique
- It turns you into a PM
- Mission.md docs
- Treat the claude like a compilter
- AI makes for porous borders
- Every repo should have a built-in CLI to organize all the random python scripts and tools that get vibe coded
