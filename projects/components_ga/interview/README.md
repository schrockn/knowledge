## Document Guidelines

### For Downstream Agents
- All documents contain maximum detail from interviews
- Direct quotes are marked and preserved verbatim
- Technical examples are actual configurations discussed
- Strategic implications are explicitly drawn out
- Each document is self-contained with full context

### Detail Level
These documents are intentionally comprehensive because:
1. They serve as source material for PRD generation
2. Multiple agents may process different aspects
3. Details prevent information loss in handoffs
4. Context enables better decision-making

## Interview Methodology

### Approach
1. **Question Framework**: Using prompts.md as guide
2. **Template Structure**: Following Linear's template.md format
3. **Reference Example**: Using priority_micro_adjust_example.md for detail level
4. **Progressive Refinement**: Each section builds on previous

### Validation Process
1. Complete section interview
2. Create detailed documentation
3. Present to user for validation
4. Incorporate feedback
5. Proceed to next section

## Next Steps

1. **User Validation**: Review Sections 1 and 2 for accuracy and completeness
2. **Feedback Integration**: Update documents based on user input
3. **Section 3 Interview**: Conduct milestone planning discussion
4. **PRD Generation**: Use completed interview docs to generate final PRD
