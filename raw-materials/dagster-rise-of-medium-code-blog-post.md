# The Rise of Medium Code

**Author:** Nick Schrock  
**Published:** June 10, 2024

The software development landscape has been traditionally divided into two camps: high-code (full-stack development) and low-code/no-code solutions. However, a new category is emerging that sits between these extremes: medium code.

## What is Medium Code?

Medium code represents a new paradigm in software development characterized by:

- **Turing Complete Languages**: Uses real programming languages like Python, SQL, or JavaScript
- **Version Control Integration**: Code is versioned and follows software development lifecycle practices
- **Internal Abstractions**: Has its own abstractions and patterns
- **Production Ready**: Runs in production environments
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Abstracts away complex infrastructure concerns

This approach enables practitioners who aren't traditional full-stack engineers to create mission-critical software using more accessible, domain-specific tools.

## Medium-Code Practitioners

The rise of medium code has enabled new types of software practitioners:

### Analytics Engineers
- Bridge the gap between data engineering and analytics
- Use tools like dbt to transform data using SQL
- Create production data pipelines without deep infrastructure knowledge

### Data Scientists
- Move beyond notebooks to production-ready ML systems
- Use frameworks that abstract deployment complexity
- Focus on model logic rather than infrastructure

### Infrastructure Engineers
- Create reusable abstractions for other teams
- Build platforms that enable medium-code development
- Reduce cognitive load for domain experts

## The AI Factor

One might assume that AI will eliminate the need for medium-code practitioners by automating code generation. However, Schrock argues the opposite:

> "Far from eliminating the medium-code practitioner, we believe that AI will only accelerate this trend across multiple domains"

### Why AI Enhances Rather Than Replaces

1. **Productivity Acceleration**: AI tools make medium-code practitioners more productive
2. **Code Generation**: AI can generate boilerplate and common patterns
3. **Human Oversight Required**: Complex business logic still requires human judgment
4. **Context Awareness**: Practitioners provide domain knowledge that AI lacks

## The Future of Medium Code

Medium code represents a fundamental shift in how we think about software development:

- **Democratization**: More domain experts can create production software
- **Specialization**: Tools become more domain-specific and powerful
- **Abstraction Layers**: Infrastructure complexity is hidden behind better interfaces
- **AI Integration**: AI becomes a force multiplier rather than a replacement

## Key Implications

1. **Tool Evolution**: Development tools will continue to become more specialized and accessible
2. **Role Expansion**: Traditional roles will expand to include more software development
3. **Productivity Gains**: Organizations can leverage domain expertise more effectively
4. **Skills Development**: Practitioners need to develop medium-code skills alongside domain expertise

## Conclusion

The rise of medium code represents a significant evolution in software development, creating new opportunities for domain experts to build mission-critical software. Rather than being threatened by AI, medium-code practitioners will likely find their roles enhanced and their productivity accelerated by intelligent tooling.

This trend suggests a future where software development becomes more distributed across organizations, with specialized tools enabling more people to contribute to production systems while maintaining quality and reliability standards.
