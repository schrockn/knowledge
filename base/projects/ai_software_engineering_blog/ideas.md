# Blog Ideas from Shower Thoughts

Collection of AI software engineering blog post ideas extracted from base/shower-thoughts/.

- **"It Turns You Into a PM"** - How AI coding assistants fundamentally change the developer role from writing code to managing and directing AI agents

- **"Treat Claude Like a Compiler"** - Treating AI as a development tool with structured inputs/outputs rather than a conversational partner

- **"Difficult to Follow Instructions"** - The challenge of getting AI to consistently follow coding instructions and strategies for better prompt engineering

- **"Structured Process for Complex Tasks"** - The decorator migration story - why providing structured processes is crucial for complex AI-assisted refactoring

- **"Manual Review Still Important"** - Why human review remains critical in AI-assisted development workflows despite automation capabilities

- **"Fast Tests and Tools Important"** - How AI amplifies the importance of fast feedback loops and optimizing development velocity

- **"Repo Built-in CLI"** - Every repo should have a built-in CLI to organize random Python scripts and tools that get "vibe coded" during AI development

- **"Coarse-Grained Modules Important"** - Why refactoring into coarse-grained modules becomes more important in AI-assisted development

- **"Refactor to Generalization Technique"** - Specific prompting technique: asking AI to "refactor to generalization" as an effective way to improve code

- **"Refactoring Good, Token Intensive"** - AI is excellent at refactoring but computationally expensive - balancing quality with efficiency

- **"Incredible at Searching Historically"** - AI's strength in searching through historical context, codebases, and documentation

- **"AI Makes Porous Borders"** - How AI breaks down traditional boundaries in software development between roles, tools, and development phases

- **"Jargon Knowledge Useful"** - Why software engineering jargon becomes more important when working with AI for precise communication

- **"Mission.md Docs"** - The importance of project mission/context documentation for AI-assisted development
