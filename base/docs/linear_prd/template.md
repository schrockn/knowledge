# Linear PRD Template

Linear uses a simple, three-section PRD format that moves from highest level to most granular, widest audience to narrower, and least likely to change to most likely to change.

## Structure Overview

### 1. Context (Stable - Should Not Change)
- **Audience**: General - everyone needs to understand this regardless of role
- **Purpose**: Fundamental motivation for building the feature
- **Content**: Marketing statement, why now, why we'll win

### 2. Usage Scenarios (Pretty Stable - Minor Refinements Expected)  
- **Audience**: Product, sales, and marketing teams
- **Purpose**: Help visualize who we're building for with real-life narratives
- **Content**: Actual user stories anchored to specific moments in time

### 3. Milestones (Living Document - Changes Frequently)
- **Audience**: The team actually working on the feature  
- **Purpose**: Coordination and ship risk management
- **Content**: Checkpoints, releases, incremental features, build order, risk mitigation

## Template

### Context

**What is the marketing statement for this feature?**
[One sentence that captures what this feature enables]

**Why are we building this now?**
[Market timing, user pain points, strategic importance]

**Why do we deserve to win with this feature?**
[Our unique advantages, competitive positioning, special insights]

### Usage Scenarios

**Scenario 1: [Primary Use Case]**
When [specific person] was [doing specific task] at [specific time/context], they [encountered specific situation]. They use [feature name] to [specific action] because [specific benefit/outcome].

**Scenario 2: [Secondary Use Case]**
[Follow same format as above]

**Scenario 3: [Edge Case or Advanced Use Case]**
[Follow same format as above]

### Milestones

**Milestone 1: [Early/Foundation Work]**
- Scope: [What gets built]
- Purpose: [What this de-risks or enables]
- Success criteria: [How we know it's done]

**Milestone 2: [Core Functionality]** 
- Scope: [What gets built]
- Purpose: [What this de-risks or enables]
- Success criteria: [How we know it's done]

**Milestone 3: [Polish/Enhancement]**
- Scope: [What gets built] 
- Purpose: [What this de-risks or enables]
- Success criteria: [How we know it's done]

## Guidelines for Writing

### Context Section
- Keep it high-level and strategic
- Make it compelling - this is your elevator pitch
- Focus on the "why" not the "what" or "how"
- Should remain stable throughout development

### Usage Scenarios  
- Use real people and real situations when possible
- Be specific about timing and context
- Show the user's workflow, not just the feature
- Help readers visualize the user experience

### Milestones
- Order by risk and dependency, not importance
- Include what you're learning/de-risking with each milestone
- Be prepared to adjust scope and number as you build
- Focus on incremental value delivery

## Example Structure Reference

For a concrete example of this format in action, see Linear's internal PRD structure used for features they've shipped. The key is starting broad and strategic, then getting specific about user workflows, then tactical about implementation phases.
