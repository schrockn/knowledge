# Linear PRD Information Gathering Prompts

This document provides a structured approach to gathering information for writing Linear PRDs by focusing on one section at a time.

## Section Selection

**PRD Focus Area - Which section would you like to work on?**

- **Context** - The strategic foundation (marketing statement, timing, competitive advantage)
- **Usage Scenarios** - User narratives anchored to real situations
- **Milestones** - Implementation phases and checkpoints

---

## Context Section Prompts

Use these questions to gather the strategic foundation:

### Marketing Statement

- What does this feature enable users to do that they can't do today?
- How would you describe this feature in one compelling sentence?
- What's the core value proposition?

### Timing Rationale

- What's happening in the market right now that makes this the right time?
- What user pain points or requests are driving this?
- How does this fit into your current product strategy?
- Why now versus 6 months ago or 6 months from now?

### Competitive Advantage

- What unique insights or advantages do you have for this feature?
- Why will you build this better than competitors?
- What makes your approach different or special?
- What do you know that others don't?

## Usage Scenarios Section Prompts

Gather 2-3 concrete user narratives:

### For Each Scenario

- **Specific User**: Can you think of a specific user (real person if possible) who would use this?
- **Context**: What were they trying to accomplish when they encountered the problem?
- **Situation**: What was the specific context - when, where, what were they working on?
- **Workflow**: Walk me through exactly what they would do with this feature
- **Outcome**: What outcome or benefit do they get from using it?

### Scenario Coverage

- Are there different types of users who would use this differently?
- What's the most common use case vs. advanced use cases?
- Any edge cases or unusual scenarios we should consider?
- Do the scenarios cover the full range of intended users?

---

## Milestones Section Prompts

Plan the implementation phases:

### Overall Planning

- What's the core functionality that must exist for this to be useful?
- What are the biggest risks or unknowns we need to validate early?
- What can be built incrementally vs. what needs to be complete?
- Are there dependencies on other systems or teams?

### For Each Milestone

- **Scope**: What specifically gets built in this phase?
- **User Value**: What does this milestone allow users to do?
- **Learning**: What does this milestone teach us or de-risk?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know this milestone is successful?
- **Next Steps**: What comes next after this milestone?

### Risk Assessment

- What could go wrong with this approach?
- What assumptions are we making that need validation?
- What would cause us to change course?
- What's the minimum viable version of this feature?

## Usage Instructions

1. **Choose a section** to focus on first (recommend starting with Context)
2. **Work through the prompts** for that section systematically
3. **Capture responses** in the appropriate section of the PRD template
4. **Move to next section** once current section feels complete
5. **Iterate** - you can always come back and refine sections as you learn more

The key is to stay focused on one section at a time rather than jumping around, which helps maintain the proper level of detail and audience focus for each section.
