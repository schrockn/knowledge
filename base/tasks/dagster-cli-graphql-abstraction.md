# Dagster CLI GraphQL Abstraction

## Overview

Write up in more detail the concept of adding CLI commands to DG (Dagster) to query Plus through a GraphQL-to-REST abstraction layer.

## Initial Concept

This should have a light abstraction that allows the CLI to wrap the GraphQL API in a way that feels like a REST API. Inspiration could be gotten from Sofa. This is a very AI friendly task.

## Areas to Explore

- Research Sofa framework and how it converts GraphQL to REST
- Define CLI command structure and interface design
- Analyze current Dagster Plus GraphQL API surface
- Design abstraction layer architecture
- Consider developer experience and usability patterns
