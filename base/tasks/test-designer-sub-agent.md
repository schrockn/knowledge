# Test Designer Sub-Agent

**Original thought:** "Add test designer sub agent"

## Objective

Implement a specialized sub-agent that can design and generate test cases automatically.

## Context

This sub-agent would help with the dg-plus-api project by automatically generating comprehensive test suites for the API endpoints and CLI commands we're building.

## Scope

The sub-agent should be capable of:

- Analyzing API specifications and generating appropriate test cases
- Creating both unit and integration tests
- Identifying edge cases and error conditions
- Generating test data and mock scenarios
