# GraphQL Changes Porting Automation

**Original thought:** "Automation around porting graphql changes"

## Objective

Develop automation workflows to streamline the process of porting GraphQL schema and resolver changes between environments or versions.

## Background

As part of the dg-plus-api project, we need efficient ways to manage GraphQL changes across different contexts. This includes porting changes between development, staging, and production environments, as well as handling schema evolution over time.

## Scope

Create tooling and processes that reduce manual work in:

- Schema migration between environments
- Resolver updates and synchronization
- Breaking change management
- Version compatibility handling
