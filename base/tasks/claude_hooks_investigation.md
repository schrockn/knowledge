# Claude Hooks Investigation

## Objective
Investigate Claude hooks for guaranteed dev workflows, specifically to ensure tools like ruff run deterministically instead of relying on CLAUDE.md instructions.

## Problem Statement
Currently adding linting/formatting instructions to CLAUDE.md files doesn't always get consistent results. Claude hooks could provide active enforcement by automatically triggering these tools at appropriate moments.

## Research Areas
- [ ] How Claude hooks work and what events they can respond to
- [ ] Setting up hooks for linting/formatting tools (ruff, eslint, prettier, etc.)
- [ ] Hook configuration patterns and best practices
- [ ] Integration with existing development workflows
- [ ] Performance implications of hooks

## Hypothesis
Claude hooks can provide deterministic tool execution where CLAUDE.md passive instructions fail, ensuring consistent code quality without relying on AI memory/consistency.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Read Claude Code hooks documentation
- [ ] Test basic hook setup with ruff
- [ ] Compare reliability vs CLAUDE.md approach
- [ ] Document findings and recommend patterns
