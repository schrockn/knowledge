# Context Store Enterprise Investigation

## Objective

Investigate how to manage context more seriously in the enterprise, building on our current git-based approach while enabling context sharing and installation across organizational boundaries.

## Background

Phone discussion with Pete highlighted the opportunity to expand our differentiated git-based context approach. Current system is unique but could be enhanced to support enterprise-scale context management.

## Key Concepts Discussed

### Context Package Installation

The ability to "install" context from various sources:

- Other teams within the same organization
- Parent organizations or subsidiaries
- Service-specific context (e.g., Stripe API patterns, Salesforce data models)
- Industry-specific knowledge packages

### Organizational Context Hierarchy

How context flows and is shared across different organizational levels and boundaries while maintaining appropriate access controls and relevance.

### Integration-Specific Context

Context packages tailored to common enterprise integrations - not just API documentation but patterns, common pitfalls, organizational-specific configurations, and institutional knowledge.

## Current State

Our git-based approach provides a strong foundation with version control, collaboration, and reproducibility. The question is how to extend this to support packageable, installable, and shareable context while maintaining the benefits of our current system.

## Notes

This feels like there's "something here" but concrete implementation ideas are still emerging. The opportunity lies in taking our unique git-based approach and making it enterprise-scalable while preserving its core advantages.
