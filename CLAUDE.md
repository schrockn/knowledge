# Project Organization Guidelines

This repository is organized into discrete projects under the `projects/` directory. Each project should be self-contained with its own purpose and scope.

## Project Guidelines

1. **Self-contained**: Each project should contain everything needed to understand and work on that specific initiative
2. **Clear scope**: Projects should have well-defined boundaries and objectives  
3. **Flexible structure**: Projects can organize their materials however makes sense for their specific needs
4. **Documentation**: Each project must have a CLAUDE.md file with project-specific context and instructions

## Working with Projects

When working on a specific project:
1. Always check the project's CLAUDE.md for specific instructions and context
2. Keep project materials isolated within the project directory
3. Organize materials in whatever way makes sense for that particular project
4. Update project documentation as the work evolves
